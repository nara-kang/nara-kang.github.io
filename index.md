<p>
 Welcome! I am Nara Kang, a Ph.D. candidate in political science
 at Michigan State University.
<p>
 I am studying comparative politics and political economy,
 with a focus on income inequality, redistribution, labor market policy, 
 and electoral systems.
 My dissertation explores how domestic economic conditions 
 shape political outcomes under different institutional contexts. 
 Specifically, I aim to examine three questions as follows:
<p>
 (1) Under what conditions the middle class allies with low-income groups and
 support redistribution? How do such preferences vary by institutional contexts?;
 (2) when the working class is divided into two groups, labor market insiders with job security
 and labor market outsiders without it,
 under what conditions the heterogeneity within the working class affects support for radical right parties?; and, 
 (3) why elderly poverty does not translate into preferences for redistribution?
